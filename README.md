**OADlib** library is a set of tools that can be useful in reconstructing a gas cell's resonance frequency by the data of its temperature with the use of LSTM-based neural networks. The structure of the OADlib is the following:
```text
.
├── __init__.py
├── README.md        \\ The library documentation
├── data/            \\ The directory with raw and preprocessed data
├── dataset/         \\ The directory with an implementation of a OAD dataset class
├── logging/         \\ The directory with an implementation of a logger manager class
├── models/          \\ The directory with implementations of LSTM-based neural network models
└── preprocessing/   \\ The directory with an implementation of a data preprocessing class
```
